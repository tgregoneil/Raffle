Raffle is a simple Raffle program where a fuse randomly makes its way through a maze to randomly zap the losers of the contest.

Separate each name with a newline in the textarea.  Specify number of winners for the contest (1 to number_of_entrants-1).  Click Start.

A page with the entries, a red 'Light Fuse' button and a maze will be presented.  
Click the red 'Light Fuse' button to observe the fuse making its way through the maze to zap all the losers.

Click 'Show Winners' button to see the remaining winners.
